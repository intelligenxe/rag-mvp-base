# rag-mvp-base
**rag-mvp-base** was derived from [rag-mvp-basic](https://github.com/intelligenxe/rag-mvp-basic) by refactoring the latter by converting class methods into standalone functions, each placed in independent files within a Python package.  This refactoring was done so that [different open-source contributors can work on separate files in isolation](https://claude.ai/share/aef2ee14-fa1b-49de-8902-ba51451b6fe1):

Claude Code was used for the above refactoring.
For comparison purposes this is the equivalent refactoring proposed by [Claude](https://claude.ai/share/91f36df3-febb-4120-838e-ef9b80c3a06e) (different from Claude Code).
